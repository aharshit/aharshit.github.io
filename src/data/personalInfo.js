      intro: "someone, who loves building, breaking, and fixing things with technology. Currently doing my Master’s at Purdue, I’m always on the lookout for interesting problems to solve and new skills to pick up along the way. Whether it’s coding, collaborating, or just experimenting with ideas, I enjoy turning concepts into something real (and hopefully useful).",
      additional: "when I’m not buried in code or research, you’ll probably find me playing the violin, watching movies like I’m training for a marathon, or following cricket with the intensity of a national selector."
